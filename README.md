# DataFest2YCs 

**The 2026 event will be held during the weekend of March 27 - 29**

American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest for Two-Year Colleges (2YC) through AMATYC

**DataFest for Two-Year Colleges** is a partnership between ASA and AMATYC (American Mathematics Association for Two-Year Colleges). We offer this data challenge to two-year college students in teams of 2-5. 

# What is DataFest? 

DataFest is a weekend-long celebration of data in which teams of undergraduates work around the clock over a two-day period to find and share meaning in a large, rich, and complex data set. More information about ASA DataFest can be found at: [https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/] 

A key feature of ASA DataFest is that it brings together the data science community. Undergraduate students do the work, but they may be assisted by consultants who are alumni, graduate students, faculty, and industry professionals. Many professionals find ASA DataFest to be a great recruiting opportunity–they get to watch talented undergraduate students work under pressure in a team and examine their thinking processes.

After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, and presentation design, each team is allowed 2 slides (plus one title slide) and a maximum 5-minute video presentation to impress a panel of judges. Awards are given for Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Statistical Analysis.
